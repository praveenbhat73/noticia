// By using useEffect Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. 
// React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. 
// In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API, directly updating DOM and timers
//by default it renders every time its updated
// useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
